How to? Echoprint: Installing Echoprint Server on Ubuntu
The Echoprint server is a custom component for Apache Solr to index Echoprint codes and hash times. In order to keep the index fast, the Echoprint codes are stored in a Tokyo Tyrant key/value store. The github for Echoprint server assumes that TokyoTyrant is already installed on the machine on which you are going to install and run the Echoprint server.

Installing Tokyo Cabinet

Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a value. There is neither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or fixed-length array. More information can be obtained here.

The latest version can be obtained here. I will be using version 1.4.32 for this article. This version can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tokyocabinet/files/tokyocabinet/1.4.32/tokyocabinet-1.4.32.tar.gz/download. Following are the steps to install TokyoCabinet in directory /usr/local/tokyocabinet-

wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/tokyocabinet/files/tokyocabinet/1.4.32/tokyocabinet-1.4.32.tar.gz
tar xvf tokyocabinet-1.4.32.tar.gz
cd tokyocabinet-1.4.32
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
sudo mkdir /usr/local/tokyocabinet-1.4.21/
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/tokyocabinet-1.4.21/
make
sudo make install


Installing Tokyo Tyrant

Tokyo Tyrant is a package of network interface to Tokyo Cabinet. Tokyo Tyrant is provided for concurrent and remote connections to Tokyo Cabinet. It is composed of the server process managing a database and its access library for client applications. You can find the latest version of Tokyo Tyrant here. For this article I will use version 1.1.33 that can be obtained from here.

wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/tokyocabinet/files/tokyotyrant/1.1.33/tokyotyrant-1.1.33.tar.gz
tar xvf tokyotyrant-1.1.27.tar.gz
cd tokyotyrant-1.1.33
sudo mkdir /usr/local/tokyotyrant-1.1.33
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/tokyotyrant-1.1.33/ --with-tc=/usr/local/tokyocabinet-1.4.32/
make
sudo make install
You are ready to run Tokyo Torent server.

/usr/local/tokyotyrant-1.1.33/bin/ttserver


Note: 

In some cases you might see following error: error while loading shared libraries: libtokyocabinet.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. Use following steps to fix this error

cd /usr/local/tokyotyrant-1.1.33/
ln -s /usr/local/tokyocabinet-1.4.32/lib/libtokyocabinet.so.8 lib/
Installing Echoprint Server

You can get more information here. I will use all default options to install the server, i.e., echoprint-server and ttserver on same machine and echoprint-server and port at localhost:8502. If you want to modify any of these you can find information at the above link.

Create a directory where you want to install the server. For this article I will use /home/smishra/echoprint
cd /home/smishra/echoprint
git init
git pull git://github.com/echonest/echoprint-server.git
cd echoprint/solr/solr
java -Dsolr.solr.home=~/workspace/echoprint/solr/solr/solr/ -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar start.jar
install python-setuptools: sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
install web.py module: sudo easy_install web.py
install pyechonest: sudo easy_install pyechonest

Now you are ready to run python API examples given under echoprint-server/API
